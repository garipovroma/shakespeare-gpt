# GPT-2 Fine-tuning on Shakespeare dataset

ShakespeareGPT is a [GPT2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) model fine-tuned on the [Shakespeare dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays). 

In this repository you can find the code for training the model and generating text from it.

The fine-tuned model is available on the [ðŸ¤— HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/garipovroma/gpt_2_shakespeare_finetuned). You can infer it right in your browser!

### Setup
```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/garipovroma/shakespeare-gen
cd shakespeare-gen

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Prepare data
python3 scripts/prepare_data.py
```

## Train model
There are a few options to train the model:
```
usage: train.py [-h] [--data_folder DATA_FOLDER] [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE]
                [--use_scheduler USE_SCHEDULER] [--num_epochs NUM_EPOCHS] [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE]
                [--max_seq_len MAX_SEQ_LEN] [--device DEVICE] [--seed SEED] [--num_workers NUM_WORKERS]
                [--out_folder OUT_FOLDER] [--train_verbose TRAIN_VERBOSE] [--push_flag PUSH_FLAG]
                [--huggingface_token HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN] [--use_wandb USE_WANDB]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --data_folder DATA_FOLDER
                        path to the data folder
  --learning_rate LEARNING_RATE
                        learning rate
  --use_scheduler USE_SCHEDULER
                        use scheduler flag
  --num_epochs NUM_EPOCHS
                        number of epochs
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        batch size
  --max_seq_len MAX_SEQ_LEN
                        max sequence length
  --device DEVICE       device to run the model on
  --seed SEED           seed for random number generators
  --num_workers NUM_WORKERS
                        number of workers for data loaders
  --out_folder OUT_FOLDER
                        folder to save the model and tokenizer
  --train_verbose TRAIN_VERBOSE
                        number of batches after which to print the training loss
  --push_flag PUSH_FLAG
                        push to hub flag
  --huggingface_token HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
                        huggingface token
  --use_wandb USE_WANDB
                        use wandb flag
```

``` 
python3 scripts/train.py
```

## Generate text
The nucleus sampling is used for text generation.

For generating text you can use the following script:

```
usage: generate.py [-h] [--load_mode {huggingface,torch}] --model MODEL --tokenizer TOKENIZER [--device DEVICE] --prompt PROMPT [--out_prompts OUT_PROMPTS] [--result_length RESULT_LENGTH]
                   [--top_p TOP_P] [--temperature TEMPERATURE] [--seed SEED]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --load_mode {huggingface,torch}
                        where from to load the model and tokenizer
  --model MODEL         path to the model or the model name on huggingface
  --tokenizer TOKENIZER
                        path to the tokenizer or the tokenizer name on huggingface
  --device DEVICE       device to run the model on
  --prompt PROMPT       prompt to generate from
  --out_prompts OUT_PROMPTS
                        number of prompts to generate
  --result_length RESULT_LENGTH
                        approximate length of the generated text
  --top_p TOP_P         top p parameter for nucleus sampling
  --temperature TEMPERATURE
                        temperature parameter for softmax
  --seed SEED           seed for random number generators
```

Example
```
python3 scripts/generate.py --model garipovroma/gpt_2_shakespeare_finetuned --tokenizer garipovroma/gpt_2_shakespeare_finetuned --prompt "To be or not to be" --out_prompts 5 --result_length 200
